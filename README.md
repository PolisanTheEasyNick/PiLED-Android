The PiLED Android Client is designed to interact with the PiLED server running on a Raspberry Pi. It allows you to control an LED strip connected to the Pi's GPIO pins directly from your Android device over a network. With this app, you can set LED colors, trigger animations, and synchronize with other OpenRGB-enabled devices.  

# Features
* Change LED Colors: Adjust the LED strip's colors and set durations for smooth transitions.
* Animations: Supports fade and pulse animations with adjustable speed and duration.
* Synchronization with OpenRGB: If your PiLED server is connected to an OpenRGB server, the Android app can send color changes to sync with your PC's RGB devices.
* Connection Options: Connect—ñ via TCP directly to the PiLED server.
* Suspend Mode: Toggle suspend mode to turn off LEDs and ignore non-suspend commands until re-enabled.
* NFC Integration: If your device supports NFC, you can trigger specific actions by scanning an NFC tag (tag must be with `piled://room_presence` data.). It will toggle `Suspend` mode. While suspended, PiLED will turn off all lights and will ignore all commands but `Suspend`.
